Connection Object
*****************

.. note::

    Any outstanding changes will be rolled back when the connection object
    is destroyed or closed.



.. method:: Connection.__enter__()

    The entry point for the connection as a context manager, a feature
    available in Python 2.5 and higher. It returns itself.

    .. note::

        This method is an extension to the DB API definition.


.. method:: Connection.__exit__()

    The exit point for the connection as a context manager, a feature available
    in Python 2.5 and higher. In the event of an exception, the transaction is
    rolled back; otherwise, the transaction is committed.

    .. note::

        This method is an extension to the DB API definition.


.. attribute:: Connection.action

    This write-only attribute sets the action column in the v$session table. It
    is a string attribute and cannot be set to None -- use the empty string
    instead.

    .. note::

        This attribute is an extension to the DB API definition.


.. attribute:: Connection.autocommit

    This read-write attribute determines whether autocommit mode is on or off.
    When autocommit mode is on, all statements are committed as soon as they
    have completed executing.

    .. note::

        This attribute is an extension to the DB API definition.


.. method:: Connection.begin([formatId, transactionId, branchId])

    Explicitly begin a new transaction. Without parameters, this explicitly
    begins a local transaction; otherwise, this explicitly begins a distributed
    (global) transaction with the given parameters. See the Oracle
    documentation for more details.

    Note that in order to make use of global (distributed) transactions, the
    :attr:`~Connection.internal_name` and :attr:`~Connection.external_name`
    attributes must be set.

    .. note::

        This method is an extension to the DB API definition.


.. method:: Connection.cancel()

    Cancel a long-running transaction.

    .. note::

        This method is an extension to the DB API definition.


.. method:: Connection.changepassword(oldpassword, newpassword)

    Change the password of the logon.

    .. note::

        This method is an extension to the DB API definition.


.. attribute:: Connection.client_identifier

    This write-only attribute sets the client_identifier column in the
    v$session table.

    .. note::

        This attribute is an extension to the DB API definition.


.. attribute:: Connection.clientinfo

    This write-only attribute sets the client_info column in the v$session
    table.

    .. note::

        This attribute is an extension to the DB API definition.


.. method:: Connection.close()

    Close the connection now, rather than whenever __del__ is called. The
    connection will be unusable from this point forward; an Error exception
    will be raised if any operation is attempted with the connection.

    All open cursors and LOBs created by the connection will be closed and will
    also no longer be usable.

    Internally, references to the connection are held by cursor objects,
    LOB objects, subscription objects, etc. Once all of these references are
    released, the connection itself will be closed automatically. Either
    control references to these related objects carefully or explicitly close
    connections in order to ensure sufficient resources are available.


.. method:: Connection.commit()

    Commit any pending transactions to the database.


.. attribute:: Connection.current_schema

    This read-write attribute sets the current schema attribute for the
    session. Setting this value is the same as executing the SQL statement
    "ALTER SESSION SET CURRENT_SCHEMA". The attribute is set (and verified) on
    the next call that does a round trip to the server. The value is placed
    before unqualified database objects in SQL statements you then execute.

    .. note::

        This attribute is an extension to the DB API definition.


.. method:: Connection.cursor()

    Return a new :ref:`cursor object <cursorobj>` using the connection.

    bound to a statement executed on any cursor associated with this
    connection.  The method signature is handler(cursor, value, arraysize) and
    the return value is expected to be a variable object or None in which case
    a default variable object will be created. If this attribute is None, the
    default behavior will take place for all values bound to statements.

    .. note::

.. attribute:: Connection.outputtypehandler

    This read-write attribute specifies a method called for each column that is
    going to be fetched from any cursor associated with this connection. The
    method signature is handler(cursor, name, defaultType, length, precision,
    scale) and the return value is expected to be a variable object or None in
    which case a default variable object will be created. If this attribute is

    .. note::

        This method is an extension to the DB API definition.


.. method:: Connection.rollback()

    Rollback any pending transactions.


.. method:: Connection.shutdown([mode])

    Shutdown the database. In order to do this the connection must be connected
    as :data:`~cx_Oracle.SYSDBA` or :data:`~cx_Oracle.SYSOPER`. Two calls must
    be made unless the mode specified is :data:`~cx_Oracle.DBSHUTDOWN_ABORT`.
    An example is shown below:

    ::

        import cx_Oracle

        connection = cx_Oracle.Connection(mode = cx_Oracle.SYSDBA)
        connection.shutdown(mode = cx_Oracle.DBSHUTDOWN_IMMEDIATE)
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute("alter database close normal")
        cursor.execute("alter database dismount")
        connection.shutdown(mode = cx_Oracle.DBSHUTDOWN_FINAL)

    .. note::

        This method is an extension to the DB API definition.


.. method:: Connection.startup(force=False, restrict=False)

    Startup the database. This is equivalent to the SQL\*Plus command "startup
    nomount". The connection must be connected as :data:`~cx_Oracle.SYSDBA` or
    :data:`~cx_Oracle.SYSOPER` with the :data:`~cx_Oracle.PRELIM_AUTH` option
    specified for this to work. An example is shown below:

    ::

                mode = cx_Oracle.SYSDBA | cx_Oracle.PRELIM_AUTH)
        connection.startup()
        connection = cx_Oracle.connect(mode = cx_Oracle.SYSDBA)
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute("alter database mount")
        cursor.execute("alter database open")

    .. note::

        This method is an extension to the DB API definition.


.. attribute:: Connection.stmtcachesize

    This read-write attribute specifies the size of the statement cache. This
    value can make a significant difference in performance (up to 100x) if you
    have a small number of statements that you execute repeatedly.

    .. note::

        This attribute is an extension to the DB API definition.


.. method:: Connection.subscribe(namespace=cx_Oracle.SUBSCR_NAMESPACE_DBCHANGE, protocol=cx_Oracle.SUBSCR_PROTO_OCI, callback=None, timeout=0, operations=OPCODE_ALLOPS, port=0, qos=0)

    Return a new :ref:`subscription object <subscrobj>` using the connection.
    Currently the namespace and protocol parameters cannot have any other
    meaningful values.

    The callback is expected to be a callable that accepts a single parameter.
    A :ref:`message object <msgobjects>` is passed to this callback whenever a
    notification is received.

    The timeout value specifies that the subscription expires after the given
    time in seconds. The default value of 0 indicates that the subscription
    never expires.

    The operations parameter enables filtering of the messages that are sent
    (insert, update, delete). The default value will send notifications for all
    operations.

    The port specifies the listening port for callback notifications from the
    database server. If not specified, an unused port will be selected by the
    database.

    The qos parameter specifies quality of service options. It should be one or
    more of the following flags, OR'ed together:
    :data:`cx_Oracle.SUBSCR_QOS_RELIABLE`,
    :data:`cx_Oracle.SUBSCR_QOS_DEREG_NFY`,
    :data:`cx_Oracle.SUBSCR_QOS_ROWIDS`,
    :data:`cx_Oracle.SUBSCR_QOS_QUERY`,
    :data:`cx_Oracle.SUBSCR_QOS_BEST_EFFORT`.

    .. note::

        This method is an extension to the DB API definition.

    .. note::

        Do not close the connection before the subscription object is deleted
        or the subscription object will not be deregistered in the database.
        This is done automatically if connection.close() is never called.


.. attribute:: Connection.tnsentry

    This read-only attribute returns the TNS entry of the database to which a
    connection has been established.

    .. note::

        This attribute is an extension to the DB API definition.
